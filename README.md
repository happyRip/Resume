# Resume
My personal resume, written in `RMarkdown` and automated with `GitHub Actions`.

## Instructions
To view my resume it's best to open it in [Google Docs pdf-viewer](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/happyRip/Resume/raw/master/Resume.pdf), or download the [`Resume.pdf`](https://github.com/happyRip/Resume/raw/master/Resume.pdf) file generated by [`GitHub Actions` workflow](https://github.com/happyRip/Resume/blob/master/.github/workflows/makefile.yml) and view it locally.

You can [preview the resume on GitHub](https://github.com/happyRip/Resume/blob/master/Resume.pdf), but it won't be possible to access embedded links this way.

## Personal data notice

This repository is stripped of my personal data.
